Once we are done with the setup we can load the program into the software and run the main method which is in the Sumulator Class.

The program starts by asking for the imput on what action they should take which are as :
Press 1 for  
Press 2 for

When the user presses 1 he is taken inside the program where he is asked to enter the number of months for the stimulator. The program then uses that a basis to run the program and give an output of the :
1. No. of Open Centres
2. No. of Full centres
3. No. of Traineeds currently training
4. No. of trainees in the waiting List

The data can be used by the Sparta Admin for their needs and keep track of the outputs for their organisation.
As this is finished the user is asked again if he wants to rerun the program and get more information or he wants to exit the program.

When a user presses 2 the program stops and he is taken out of the program. In order for him to start again he needs to start the whole program and then choose depending upon what action he intends to take.
